# REM Waster Re-design Project

In this project, I wanted to create basic yet modern design page. I used light colors on background, mainly tones of white with gradient to make design more attractive.

## Cards
Every skip hiring option is shown within cards with animation. Whenever user hovers on cards it goes slightly up, box-shadow changes and border gets a new color so that user can have better feeling when inspecting skip options.

## Figma
I used Figma to create a basic template on what am I going to put on cards and how I am going to put it. I didn't use any coloring in Figma, only used it for templating purpose.

## Most Popular
I added "Most Popular" and "Compact Choice" labels to the cards to increase engagement and encourage users to make a purchase.

## Reusable Components
I made footer to look more professional and put it in another file inside of src called "components". That's where I would put reusable components.

I also created UnderConstruction component which creates a starting point for future development for other pages. UnderConstruction component shows up when clicked on progress bars except for "Select Skip" page.

## Loading
I used spinner for loading animation. While fetch operation is active, it shows up spinner until data fetched from api.
